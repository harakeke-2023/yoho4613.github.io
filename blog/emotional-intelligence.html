      <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Emotional intelligence (otherwise known as emotional quotient or EQ) is
        the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive
        ways to help you make better decisions and achieve your goals. It
        involves recognizing your own emotions, understanding what they mean,
        and responding to them appropriately. Emotional intelligence also
        involves recognizing and understanding the emotions of those around you,
        and responding to them in a way that is positive and constructive.
      </p>
      <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        IQ stands for intelligence quotient, while EQ stands for emotional
        quotient. The main difference between IQ and EQ is that IQ is a measure
        of cognitive abilities and problem-solving skills while EQ is a measure
        of an individual's social and emotional competencies or one's ability to
        recognise one's own and other person's emotional expression. IQ tests
        assess cognitive abilities through vocabulary, reading comprehension and
        retention, reasoning and math skills while emotional intelligence is
        distinct from IQ and is the "ability to validly reason with emotions and
        to use emotions to enhance thought." EQ refers to an individual's
        ability to perceive, control, evaluate, and express emotions. People
        with high EQ can manage emotions, use their emotions to facilitate
        thinking, understand emotional meanings and accurately perceive others'
        emotions.

      <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Emotional intelligence (EQ) is important because it helps you build
        stronger relationships, succeed at school and work, and achieve your
        career and personal goals. Having a high level of EQ allows you to
        empathize with others, communicate effectively, and be both self and
        socially aware. EQ also has a greater impact on success than other
        factors, such as IQ. Additionally, high levels of EQ have been found to
        correlate with high levels of career success, satisfaction, and
        relationship success. Lastly, having a high EQ allows leaders to
        demonstrate better interpersonal and communication skills, which
        translates to greater team satisfaction and improved results.
