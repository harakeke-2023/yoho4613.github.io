        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the core learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Firstly, I have learnt how to think as a developer in order to solve the
        tasks that given. Secondary, I have learnt how to discuss my idea as a
        developer with other developers. Lastly, I have thought about the goal
        and my career pathway as a developer.

        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Values are guiding principles that influence our decisions and actions.
        They help us to determine what is important and meaningful to us, and
        therefore, they can play a significant role in the way we approach
        learning and problem-solving in programming. When we have a clear
        understanding of our values, we are more likely to be motivated and
        engaged in our work, and to make choices that align with our beliefs and
        principles. Empathy refers to the ability to understand and share the
        feelings of others. In the context of learning and programming, empathy
        can help us to better understand the needs and perspectives of our
        users, and to develop solutions that meet those needs in a meaningful
        and impactful way. By approaching problem-solving with empathy, we can
        create more user-centered and human-centered designs, and create
        technology that has a positive impact on people's lives. Self-awareness
        refers to an understanding of our own thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.
        In learning and programming, self-awareness can help us to identify and
        overcome our own biases and limitations, and to continuously reflect on
        and improve our own learning process. Self-awareness can also help us to
        manage our time, set realistic goals, and maintain a healthy work-life
        balance. In conclusion, values, empathy, and self-awareness are critical
        skills that can help us to be more effective, engaged, and impactful
        learners and programmers. By developing these skills, we can create more
        meaningful and impactful solutions and make a positive impact on the
        world.

        What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
       Neuroplasticity really surprised me with it's functions that allows the brain to adapt to new experiences, learn new skills, and recover from injury or disease, which has significant implications for neuroscience, medicine, and psychology.
      </p>
      <h2 class="blog__h2">
        What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
       Neuroplasticity was a challenging concept. Some of the most challenging aspects of neuroplasticity were Complexity, Variability, Measurement, Translation.

        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h2>
      <p>
        It's important for a programming school to focus on core learning in a web development bootcamp course because it provides a solid foundation for students to build their skills upon. Core learning typically involves learning fundamental concepts, principles, and techniques that underpin a specific field, which in this case is web development.
      </p>
      <h2 class="blog__h2">
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </h2>
      <p>
        In my view, it is important to strike a balance between core learning and practical programming in a web development bootcamp course. While practical programming exercises and projects are essential for building technical skills, core learning provides a foundation for deeper understanding and problem-solving in web development.
