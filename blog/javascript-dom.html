        Non-technical could mean writing this as if it was a blog post you would
        have wanted to read when you first started learning these concepts or to
        a friend who wants a better understanding of what you are learning. You
        should show examples of code and screenshots to help teach others!
      </h2>
      <p>
        If you're interested in learning about coding, you're in the right
        place! Coding can seem complicated and overwhelming, but with the right
        tools, you'll be able to understand and work with it in no time. At its
        core, coding is a language used to communicate with computers. It's made
        up of languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and more. Each
        language has its own syntax and rules, and they all work together to
        create websites, apps, and more. Learning to code takes dedication and
        practice. But, before you jump right in, it's important to understand
        the basics. Here are some key concepts you need to know to get started:
        • Variables: A variable is a name given to a piece of data or a value.
        It helps store information for later use. • Syntax: Syntax is the set of
        rules that determines how a language is written. It’s important to
        ensure that the syntax of the code is correct before you can start using
        it. • Control Flow: Control flow is the order in which the programming
        code is executed. It helps you control what your program does and when
        it does it. • Debugging: Debugging is the process of finding and fixing
        errors in your code. It's important to find and fix bugs early in the
        development process. Now that you have the basics, you can start
        learning and practicing coding. You can find tutorials online or sign up
        for a coding course to get a more in-depth understanding. There are also
        many online communities that are dedicated to helping new coders learn
        and grow. Coding is a complex skill, and it takes time, patience, and
        dedication to master. But if you take it one step at a time and stay
        motivated, you'll be able to create amazing things with code!

        An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.
      </h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript can be seen as the glue that binds HTML and CSS together.
        Just like glue, JavaScript's purpose is to connect them, and make them
        work together to create a user interface. HTML provides the structure
        and underlying content of the page, while CSS is the styling layer that
        defines how the page looks. JavaScript provides the interactivity,
        allowing the user to control and manipulate elements on the page.
        Without JavaScript, HTML and CSS would work together to create a static
        website, but with JavaScript, the website can become dynamic and
        interactive.

        Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
        life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).
      </h2>
      <p>
        Control flow and loops are important elements of programming that allow
        the computer to make decisions, execute certain tasks, and repeat
        processes. In an everyday example, think of doing laundry. When doing
        laundry, you must first make a decision about what laundry to do. This
        is like a control flow statement; it has logic to determine what tasks
        will be done. Next, you must complete multiple tasks, such as sorting
        clothes, adding detergent, and washing. This is like a loop, because it
        is a set of instructions that are repeated until complete. Finally, when
        all the tasks are completed, the process ends. This is an example of a
        control flow loop in everyday life.

        Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with
        it.
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform- and language-independent
        interface that allows programs and scripts to interact with webpages and
        elements within them. It provides a tree-like structure of a webpage,
        allowing developers to access and update elements within it.
        <br />
        For example, if a developer wanted to use JavaScript to set the
        background color of a particular HTML element, they would first use the
        DOM to access it, then assign the color value. The example code below
        shows how this might look:
        <br />
        // Access the element <br />
        var el = document.getElementById('myElement'); <br />
        <br />
        // Set the background color <br />
        el.style.backgroundColor = '#FFF';
      </p>

        Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
      </h2>
      <p>
        In programming, the two main ways to store data are in arrays and
        objects. Although both are collections of data, there are some distinct
        differences between them. Arrays are indexed collections where each item
        is stored in a specific location. Items can be accessed by their index,
        starting at 0 for the first item in the array. Arrays are best for data
        that needs to be ordered, like a list of products with their prices.
        Objects are unordered collections of data, where each item is stored
        with a key. Items can be accessed by their corresponding key, which can
        be any data type - from string to number. Objects are best for data that
        needs to be associated or grouped, like a list of products with their
        specs. Both arrays and objects are versatile and can be used to store
        any type of data. However, depending on the data you need to store, one
        may be more suitable than the other.

        Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Functions are a way to organize code into easy-to-understand pieces that
        can be reused. Functions allow you to create code that is more
        efficient, scalable, and easier to debug. This reduces the amount of
        time needed to write and maintain code, making development faster and
        less expensive. Functions are used to separate a larger problem into
        smaller, more manageable pieces. This helps to make the code easier to
        read and maintain. It also allows for code reuse as the same code can be
        called multiple times without needing to rewrite it.
