    <p class="paragraph">Margin is how much space is around an object. <br>
      Padding is how much space is within an object sides and it's contents. <br>
      Border is between the margin and padding of an object. Only counted when given an actual width otherwise it's zero.
    </p>
    <h2>Padding</h2>
    <p>
      Padding is a CSS property that defines the space between an element content and its
    border (if it has a border). If an element has a border around it, padding
    will give space from that border to the element content which appears in
    that border. If an element does not have a border around it, then adding
    padding has no effect at all on that element, because there is no border to
    give space from.

    <h2>Margin</h2>
     <p>
      Margin Margin is a CSS property that defines the space of
    outside of an element to its next outside element. Margin affects elements
    that both have or do not have borders. If an element has a border, margin
    defines the space from this border to the next outer element. If an element
    does not have a border, then margin defines the space from the element
    content to the next outer element.
