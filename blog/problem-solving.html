      <p>
        I was working on a project and encountered a simple problem. I couldn't
        figure out why a piece of code wasn't working as expected. After hours
        of frustration and trying different things, I finally realized that I
        had a typo in a variable name. It was a simple mistake, but it took me a
        while to find it because I was so focused on the bigger picture. It
        taught me the importance of paying attention to the details and
        double-checking my work.
      </p>
      <p>
        To solve the problem, I used a combination of debugging techniques and
        patience. I first started by carefully reading through the code and
        checking for any syntax errors. I then added print statements to
        understand what was happening at each step. I also tried to simplify the
        code by breaking it down into smaller parts and testing each one
        individually. After a lot of trial and error, I finally stumbled upon
        the typo and was able to correct it. The combination of patience and
        systematic debugging allowed me to solve the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the process, I felt frustrated and challenged. I initially
        thought it was a simple problem that I would be able to solve quickly,
        but as time went on and I wasn't making progress, I started to feel
        discouraged. However, I also felt determined to find a solution and
        refused to give up. As I continued to debug, I experienced a mix of
        frustration, annoyance, and satisfaction as I finally discovered and
        corrected the mistake. Despite the challenges I faced, I was grateful
        for the opportunity to learn and grow as a developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned a valuable lesson in the importance of paying attention to the
        small details and not taking shortcuts. The mistake I made was a simple
        typo, but it took hours to fix because I had been so focused on the
        bigger picture. This experience taught me to slow down, double-check my
        work, and not make assumptions. It also reinforced the value of
        perseverance and determination in problem-solving. Overall, this
        experience made me a better and more mindful developer.
      </p>

      <h2 class="blog__h2">2. elegantly solved a problem.</h2>
      <p>
        The problem I encountered was a typo in a variable name in the code I
        was working on. This simple mistake was causing unexpected behavior in
        the code and preventing it from working as expected.
      </p>
      <p>
        To solve the problem, I used the following techniques: <br />
        Careful code reading: I thoroughly read through the code and checked for
        any syntax errors. <br />
        Debugging: I added print statements to understand what was happening at
        each step. <br />
        Simplification: I tried to simplify the code by breaking it down into
        smaller parts and testing each one individually. <br />
        Patience: I persevered and refused to give up, even when faced with
        frustration and challenges. <br />
        By using these techniques, I was able to identify and correct the typo
        in the variable name, which solved the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the process, I experienced a range of emotions. I started
        with a sense of frustration as I couldn't figure out why the code wasn't
        working. As I continued to debug and tried different approaches, I felt
        discouraged and began to doubt my abilities. However, I also felt
        determined to find a solution and refused to give up. When I finally
        discovered the mistake and corrected it, I felt a sense of satisfaction
        and relief. Overall, the experience was challenging, but I learned to
        persevere and stay patient in the face of difficulties.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned the importance of paying attention to details and
        double-checking my work. I also learned the value of perseverance and
        determination in problem-solving. This experience reinforced the idea
        that even small mistakes can have big impacts, and that taking the time
        to thoroughly debug can save a lot of time and frustration in the long
        run. Overall, I came away from this experience as a more mindful and
        thorough developer.

        3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
        techniques/processes:
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pseudocode</li>
        <li>Trying something</li>
        <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
        <li>Reading error messages</li>
        <li>Console.logging</li>
        <li>Googling</li>
        <li>Asking your peers for help</li>
        <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
        <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Most of time when I have faced problem, for the first step I need to console.log so I can clearly find the reason and I know what I need to search on google.
          once I found the solution by googling which is from stack overflow or somewhere else, I can solve the problem. It may happens again if I face same issue and I forgot how to fix
        but, I keep try to memorise them in my mind.
