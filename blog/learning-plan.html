   <h2>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
   <p>I would like to start a new model business by using fullstack skills. </p>
   <h2>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
   <p>
    My strength is that I can focus very well when I start studying/learning something, and my limitation would be that I sometimes put too much stress on myself.
    I have strength with focus on learning new skills and very passionate. Whenever I have chance I may learn slow but never give up and at last I will be learned.
   </p>
    <h2>
      3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? 
    </h2>
    <p>
      I never studied or working as a team. I would like to learn about team-work. I want to learn how to solve problem as a team and how to discuss with team when I face any issue
    </p>
    <h2>
      4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include: <br>
      o An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives <br>
      o What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
    </h2>
    <p>
      I will make proper project board by using tool such as trello, google etc.. by using those tool, it will be easier to mange and communicate with others.
      When things are building up, I will search by many searching engines such as google. Because I know most of situation that face to me also happends to many others, by searching I can save more time and I can figure out quickly.
     </p>
     <h2>
      5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
     </h2>
     <p>
      Firstly, I would find in discord because as doing the same project classmates would have same problem. And next, I would search on Google because there must be many people in the world who need same help with me and there are answers always.
    </p>
    <h2>
      6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
    </h2>
    <p>
      I would expect sympathy. All the actuall answers of what we need will be somewhere such as website or coding community. But we can't find friendship or team-membership in there. As we are working on same goal, we need strong bond so I will expect that.
    </p>
    <h2>
      7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I may just need enough rest and will be back to work.
